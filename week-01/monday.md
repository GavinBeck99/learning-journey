- Learned about accessibility attributes (ARIA)
- Saw TypeScript type safety in action

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Git & GitHub
- **Git** is version control - tracks code changes over time
- **GitHub** is where code lives online (like Google Drive for code)
- **SSH keys** = secure connection without passwords every time
- `git config` sets up my identity for commits
- My commits will show as "Gavin Beck" in history

### AI-Assisted Development ("Vibe Coding")
- AI can generate entire components from natural language descriptions
- "Vibe coding" = describing what you want, AI writes the code
- Professional code includes detailed comments and documentation
- TypeScript adds type safety to JavaScript (catches errors before they happen)
- Accessibility (ARIA attributes) should be built into all components
- Effective prompting is a skill - simpler prompts often work better

### TypeScript
- TypeScript is JavaScript with type checking
- Prevents bugs by catching mistakes while coding (not when app runs)
- Types like `'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger'` limit allowed values
- Interface defines what props a component accepts
- Makes code self-documenting and easier to maintain

### React Components
- Components are reusable pieces of UI
- Props pass data into components
- Children prop contains what's inside the component tags
- Default values make components easier to use
- Conditional rendering shows/hides elements based on state

### Development Environment
- **Terminal/PowerShell** = text-based computer control
- **Node.js** = runs JavaScript outside the browser
- **npm** = package manager (installs tools and libraries)
- **Cursor** = VS Code with AI capabilities built-in
- After installing software, sometimes need to restart terminal/computer

## 🤔 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: SSH Key Setup
- **Issue:** Wasn't sure where to save the SSH key
- **Solution:** Just pressed Enter for default location
- **Learning:** Default settings are usually fine for beginners

### Challenge 2: Node.js Not Recognized
- **Issue:** After installing Node.js, PowerShell said "command not found"
- **Solution:** Had to close PowerShell completely and open a new window
- **Learning:** Terminal needs to refresh to see newly installed programs
- **Also tried:** Restarting computer when closing terminal didn't work

### Challenge 3: Cursor AI Generation Timeout
- **Issue:** Complex Button component prompt took 3+ minutes, never completed
- **Solution:** Canceled and used simpler prompt instead
- **Learning:** Start simple, then add features iteratively
- **Takeaway:** AI works better with focused, simple requests
- **Alternative:** Can build complex features by asking AI to add one thing at a time

### Challenge 4: Understanding TypeScript
- **Issue:** Lots of unfamiliar syntax in generated code
- **Solution:** Asked Claude to explain TypeScript basics
- **Learning:** TypeScript is JavaScript with type safety - prevents bugs
- **Approach:** Don't need to master it now, will learn gradually through practice

### Challenge 5: File Permission Error
- **Issue:** Cursor AI couldn't save Button.tsx file directly
- **Solution:** Clicked "Skip" - AI showed code in chat, copied manually
- **Learning:** This is normal workflow - AI generates, you copy/paste
- **Benefit:** Gives you control over what goes in your files

## 📝 Questions & Wonderings

### Answered Today
- ✅ What's the difference between Git and GitHub?
  - Git = version control tool, GitHub = online hosting for Git repos
- ✅ What is TypeScript and why use it?
  - JavaScript with type checking - prevents bugs
- ✅ What is PowerShell?
  - Windows command-line interface for running text commands
- ✅ How does AI code generation work?
  - Describe what you want, AI writes code based on patterns it learned

### Still Wondering
- How do you actually RUN a React component to see it work?
  - Answer: Need full React app (coming in Week 3!)
- What makes a component truly "reusable"?
- How do professional developers structure large projects?
- When should I use AI vs write code myself?
- What's the difference between good and bad prompts for AI?

## 🎯 Goals for Tomorrow (Tuesday)

- Learn Git branching and merging
- Practice making commits with good messages
- Understand Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Create branches for different topics
- Add Tuesday log to learning journal

---

## 🌟 Wins & Reflections

### Today's Biggest Win
Successfully set up my entire development environment AND generated professional code with AI! The Button component has 120+ lines of production-quality code that would have taken me hours to write.

### What Surprised Me
- How comprehensive AI-generated code can be
- TypeScript catching errors before code runs
- Accessibility features being included automatically
- How much faster AI makes development
- That troubleshooting is part of learning (not failure!)

### What I'm Excited About
- Starting to actually BUILD things in Week 3
- Learning React properly
- Creating a portfolio of real projects
- Using AI to accelerate my learning
- Seeing my progress documented publicly

### What Was Harder Than Expected
- Getting Node.js to be recognized (had to restart)
- Waiting for complex AI generations (learned to simplify)
- Understanding all the TypeScript syntax at once
- Knowing when to wait vs when to troubleshoot

### Confidence Level: 8/10
- ✅ Feel great about tools being installed correctly
- ✅ Git basics make sense
- ✅ Understand the AI workflow now
- ✅ Ready to learn Git commands tomorrow
- ⚠️ TypeScript syntax still looks complex (but that's OK!)
- ⚠️ Can't run the code yet (but understand I will in Week 3)

### Key Mindset Shift
Realized that **not understanding everything immediately is normal**. The goal isn't to memorize, it's to gain exposure and build familiarity. Understanding deepens with practice.

## 🎓 Professional Patterns Observed

### In the Generated Button Component
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript interfaces prevent mistakes
- **Default Props:** `variant = 'primary'` makes component easier to use
- **Accessibility:** `aria-*` attributes for screen readers
- **Separation of Concerns:** Helper functions for class names
- **Documentation:** Comments explain WHY, not just WHAT
- **Flexibility:** `{...rest}` allows passing additional props
- **Loading States:** UX consideration for async operations
- **Disabled States:** Prevents user errors during operations

### What Makes Code "Professional"
- Proper TypeScript types
- Accessibility built-in
- Detailed comments
- Consistent naming conventions
- Error prevention (disabled during loading)
- Reusability through props
- Documentation for future developers
