# Week 1 - Wednesday: Git Practice & Muscle Memory

**Date:** January 23, 2026  
**Time Spent:** 1 hour  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 🎯 What I Accomplished

### Git Workflow Practice
- Practiced full Git cycle: create, add, commit, push
- Created `practice.md` and pushed successfully
- Completed workflow in ~5 minutes (faster than yesterday!)

### Branching Practice
- Created `wednesday-practice` branch
- Made changes on isolated branch
- Switched back to main (file disappeared - branch magic!)
- Merged branch into main (file reappeared!)
- Pushed merged changes to GitHub

### Files Created
- `practice.md` - Quick practice file
- `branch-test.md` - Branch isolation demonstration
- `wednesday.md` - This learning log

## 💡 Key Learnings

**Git Commands Are Becoming Natural:**
- `git status` is my go-to check
- `git add` → `git commit` → `git push` flow is memorized
- `git checkout -b` creates and switches branches in one command

**Branch Isolation is Real:**
- Files literally disappear/appear when switching branches
- Proved it by creating file on branch, switching to main (gone!), merging (back!)
- This is how professionals work safely

**Speed Improving:**
- Monday: Setup took 3 hours
- Tuesday: Git learning took 2.5 hours
- Wednesday: Practice took 1 hour
- Getting faster with repetition!

## 🎯 Confidence Check

**Git Basics:** 9/10 (very comfortable!)  
**Branching:** 8/10 (understand and can execute)  
**Speed:** 8/10 (much faster than Day 1)

## 📝 Notes

**What clicked today:** Seeing files disappear/appear when switching branches made branching concept concrete.

**New approach working:** Smaller chunks with clear checkpoints made learning easier. Could ask questions without losing my place.
