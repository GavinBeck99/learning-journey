## 💡 Key Learnings

### Open Source Contribution Process
**The workflow:**
1. Find a project (chose Twenty - relevant to my work!)
2. Fork it (make my own copy)
3. Make improvements (documentation change)
4. Create Pull Request (submit contribution)
5. Maintainers review and merge (MERGED!)

### Why Documentation Contributions Are Great First PRs
- Don't require understanding complex codebase
- Still provide value to the project
- Practice the full Git/PR workflow
- Build confidence before code contributions

### Pull Request Best Practices
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep changes small and focused
- Be respectful and professional
