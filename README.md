## 📖 About This Journey

### How This Course Was Created

This learning journey is unique - **it was designed collaboratively with AI (Claude)** through an iterative, personalized process.

**The Creation Process:**

1. **Initial Assessment** - I shared my background as a Product Manager with no coding experience
2. **Goal Setting** - Defined objective: become a PM who can build and prototype ideas
3. **Curriculum Design** - Claude designed a 12-week structured program balancing PM skills and technical development
4. **Personalization** - Course adapted to my learning style, pace, and real-world context (UTS digital learning ecosystem)
5. **Continuous Refinement** - Learning approach evolved based on my feedback (smaller chunks, integrated resources, enrichment materials)

**What Makes This Different:**

- ✅ **Tailored Curriculum** - Every lesson designed specifically for my goals and background
- ✅ **Real-World Context** - Connected to my work at UTS and Product Management experience
- ✅ **Adaptive Learning** - Course structure adjusted based on my feedback (e.g., smaller lesson chunks)
- ✅ **Enriched Content** - LinkedIn Learning courses and resources integrated at optimal points
- ✅ **Hands-On Projects** - Practical work from day one (AI-generated code, tested calculator, open source contribution)
- ✅ **Documentation-First** - Learning logs document both successes and challenges
- ✅ **AI-Assisted Development** - Learning to use AI tools (Claude, Cursor) as development partners

**The Result:**

A comprehensive, practical course that bridges Product Management and software development - something that didn't exist as a packaged offering. This repository serves as both my learning documentation and a potential template for others on similar journeys.

### Course Philosophy

**Learning by Doing** - Theory is minimal; practice is everything. Every concept is immediately applied.

**Progressive Complexity** - Start with fundamentals (Git, testing) before advancing to frameworks (React, databases).

**Professional Standards** - Learn industry best practices from the start (version control, testing, documentation).

**AI as a Tool** - Embrace AI assistance while understanding what's happening under the hood.

**Portfolio Building** - Every project contributes to a public portfolio demonstrating real skills.

### My Background

- **Role:** Manager of DLE Strategy at UTS (University of Technology Sydney)
- **Focus:** Digital learning ecosystem management
- **Experience:** Product ownership, stakeholder management, user research
- **Coding Background:** None (starting from zero)
- **Goal:** Bridge the gap between product vision and technical execution
