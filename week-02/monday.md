## 🎯 What I Learned Today

### Code Quality Principles
- Code is read far more than it's written
- Good code is: Readable, Maintainable, Reliable, Testable, Efficient
- Five clean code principles:
  1. Meaningful Names
  2. Small Functions (one thing each)
  3. Comments for WHY not WHAT
  4. Consistent Style
  5. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

### Code Review Skills
- Practiced identifying quality issues
- Found problems: unclear names, missing comments, magic numbers
- Learned difference between == and === in JavaScript
- Understand why === is safer (strict equality)

### JavaScript Concepts
- `let` vs `const` vs `var`
- `==` (loose equality - converts types) vs `===` (strict equality - no conversion)
- Why `===` is professional standard
